If the internet is credited as being the defining factor in getting elected America's first black president there is much to be said of it's power, usefulness, and reach. Whereas Obama used the internet to lower the cost of building a political brand, both Eric Koston and myself have used it to lower the cost in building a new paradigm in skateboard media, a new paradigm that happily includes, rather than excludes, an often overlooked but key component to my growth as a child, success as a professional, and skateboarding's ultimate survival; YOU, the skateboard shop. <br /><br />

It is not borne out of malice current media's inability to offer the same thing to you in regards to advertising as they do skateboard companies, it just simply does not fit into their business model nor does it probably fit into yours. Until now, unless you were a mailorder company such as CCS, or a chain shop such as Zumiez, with locations all over the country, it was bad business for you to try and advertise in traditional international skateboard media something that was better suited to local media outlets, but there are very few, if any, local media outlets that will give you the return on your investment you hope for. Spending money in The Yellow Pages, the Reader, the Weekly, Penny Saver or any other antiquated ways available to your business can be a waste. So, in the toughest economic crisis we've seen in our lifetime, how do you best attract the person you want in your shop? How do you get the word out about what you're doing? How do you compete with such massive retailers as Zumiez, PacSun, CCS etc and their massive advertising budgets? How do you not only stay in business but how do you grow your business? <b>The Berrics Unified.</b><br /><br />

There is no doubt The Berrics has been the fastest growing media entity in skateboarding's history. It is now the biggest and arguably the most influential and continues to grow. Inside your shops you may have been witness to kids talking with great enthusiasm about one of the many features on the site and as a result of this fervor some of you have even reached out to us asking how you can advertise. Knowing it would be far too expensive and ineffective we had to turn all of you away as it would have not be right for us to take what could possibly overextend you financially and you not get what you had hoped for simply because of the shear size of The Berrics and the amount of banner ads it serves on a daily basis all over the world. In other words, we did not want a Nebraska skate shop's ad inventory getting swallowed up by kids in Poland or Vietnam. <br /><br />

This problem is what gave impetus to the creation of The Berrics Unified and made us dive deeper into understanding geo targeted advertising. This is what Berrics Unified is, a geo-targeted advertising program designed specifically for your business. For those of you not familiar with geo targeting; geo targeting is the method of determining the physical location of a website visitor and delivering different content to that visitor based on his or her location. For example, if you're Subsect shop in Iowa and you know all the kids in Des Moines are going on The Berrics everyday, Berrics Unified can target your banner ads to kids in your city. If you want a bigger footprint than just your city you can get the State plan which offers more banner impressions throughout the entire state you live in. If your appetite is even larger than that, you can get the District, Region or even a 2-Region advertising plan, each with exponentially more banner inventory and bonuses. In addition to all of this, each shop will get their own profile page that includes their name, address, hours of operation, video if available, photos of their store (inside and out), their employees and links to their website and/or mailorder.<br /><br />

What can you use your banner ads for? Anything really. You can advertise upcoming sales, approaching demos, events, new product arrivals, and to those of you who do online sales, you can even advertise that. It is not a threat to us as Eric and I both firmly believe in the old saying, "a rising tide lifts all boats", in other words, general prosperity is good for all. That is the overall founding principle of The Berrics and why we created something that no other mailorder, media outlet or skateboard brand has ever been able to offer you; a direct line to the people you want in your shop and the ability to get on the communication lines of the skateboard world in the same exact way retailers 10, 100, or 1,000 times your size do. We've leveled the playing field for you.<br /><br />

This now brings me to the subject of our Canteen. Many of you have asked if we are going to expand it into a fully stocked mail order. The answer is yes and no. Yes we are expanding it, but no we are not going to be fully stocked with everything. We are primarily going to focus on pro endorsed product and most of that pro product will be our team riders. On the Canteen we will encourage that everyone check their local Berrics Unified shop first before purchasing anything online. With our easy to use map, they can find your shop and track down the product quite easily. We will also extoll the virtues of buying from your local shop such as saving on shipping, being able to actually see the board or try on the shoes before they buy them, and so on. In addition to that, our goal is to work with all of you so that when we do have a limited edition Berrics/collabo board such as Chris Cole's recent one, or shoe such as Billy Marks', or shirt such as Diamond's, you will be able to pre-book for yourselves straight from the company we're collaborating with so that when it goes up on the site, those kids who do not buy stuff online, or simply don't want to because they'd rather support their shop, but want the product, can go right into your shop the day it comes out and purchase it. Only by being a part of the Berrics Unified will you be privy to receiving the product. This benefits all involved, you, us, the professional putting himself on the line, the companies that support him and the skaters out there that keep us in business. <br /><br />

Eric and I, like you, have invested our hearts and souls into skateboarding. You have supported us along the way and made skateboarding exciting in your area. Our positions didn't happen overnight. The past two decades of dedication is what has enabled us to build something like the Berrics. Our relationships and our reputations are what has made this into a movement and it is simply not enough to share with you the movement, we want to include you in the movement so that it's your movement as well. I hope you'll join us. -- <b>steve berra</b></span>
