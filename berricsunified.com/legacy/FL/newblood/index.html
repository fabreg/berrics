			<h2>General Info / Bio</h2>
			<p>Well it all started when my grandmother (god rest her sole) got me a freestyle bike and skateboard for my 12th birthday. I thought I was cool jumpin ditches and anything I could find, then the clouds up above separated and i saw the light. A kid moved in next door and he was outside jumping speed bumps on a skateboard (jumping not ollies) I could not believe how cool. I thought my bike was the only thing I could jump, well after that day it was on. I didn't care about my bike anymore. We lived in a trailer park and down the road was a pro skater mark lake. I met his nephew and then we were 3 skaters strong. They had the coolest quarter pipe,we skated it all day everyday. then as I grew up I just got deeper into contest and the world of skateboarding. I didn't really do well in school so I tried to skate with older people so I could hang with them to skate and not go to school, I was smart but I didn't want to stay in one place for a long time. So that means job time, I had the best first job ever I was a go cart attendant at a very well known skate spot now (putt putt) so that went well and I forgot to mention I was 19 when I got that job, in between that time I just traveled and stayed away from home cause when I would go home thats when the job thing would not go away, a skater and work doesn't mix, I quit lots of jobs just to go try to make something out of myself at the tampa am every year. well I made loads of great friends and I new after time it was so hard to go pro in those days. After I got deeper in I finally found out I needed a job to keep, so where does an uneducated skater get a job pizza pizza pizza I did that for years. Then a buddy from west palm was makin boards in his garage, so I was buyin those from him and I started selling them out of the trunk any where I went, my boss even let me deliver boards with pizzas it was rad. We all would go to this park and skate every night, one night I was comin home and I looked down and my elbow was bleeding and I said I have some newblood, it clicked thats what the kids are and shit just the name did it all for me and the family. I had a few people tell me newblood no way thats not a good name, well like all the teachers and people that said skateboarding would amount to nothing for me I went ahead and I had $1000 dollas I went and found a small shop and the guy said he had a good feeling about me so he rented me my first building. I went home and I got my wife and I surprised the hell out of her but then after the hype came the feeling of the walls closing in and what I mean is I had a shop that was completely empty. The stress started to set in, o my god what am I gonna do I don't have any money what did I get myself into. Then luckily my parents gave me a truck and I asked them if I could make the truck into my life, &amp; they said wat do u mean. I told them what I went and done so they said yes u can sell the truck and start your store, that was the greatest feeling knowing for the time things were goin in my favor. So newblood began and all the newbeez were so excited as the family was. Now we are in our 4th shop. We have grown in the 7 years. There have been lots of cool people to walk threw the doors of newblood. &amp; I am proud to tell u this little story. I feel that life is wat u make it, don't let someone bring u down. Show them u are determined and u wont stop wat u love. LIVE LONG NEWBLOOD!</p>
